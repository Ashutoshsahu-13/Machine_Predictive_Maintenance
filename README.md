### Machine Predictive maintenance system
#### Introduction
Machine predictive maintenance is a proactive approach that uses advanced technologies like sensors, data analytics, and machine learning algorithms to predict when equipment or machinery is likely to fail. By continuously monitoring the performance and condition of machines, this system can identify patterns and anomalies that indicate potential issues before they escalate into costly breakdowns. It enables businesses to schedule maintenance activities at the most optimal times, reducing downtime, increasing operational efficiency, and extending the lifespan of equipment. Predictive maintenance helps organizations save costs on emergency repairs, improve safety, and maintain a seamless production process.

#### Dataset
In this, I have used the predictive_maintenance dataset which is taken form kaggel dataset. This is a dataset reports that particular parameter give results that whether machine is fail or not. The dataset  includes the UDI,Product_ID,Type,Air temperature [K],Process temperature [K],Rotational speed [rpm],	Torque [Nm],Tool wear [min]	,Target,Failure Type.

#### Step  Follwed
1. Import Neccesary Libaray.
2. Perform some EDA.
3. Remove Outlier.
4. converting categorical 
5. Handle imbalanced Dataset
6. Model Building
7. Evaluate model
8. Model Deployment
